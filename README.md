# Maze-Game


This Python project utilizes Pygame to create a maze generator and solver. The maze is randomly generated using a depth-first search algorithm, ensuring a unique layout each time. The player can then navigate through the maze using arrow keys to find the path to the exit, marked in yellow.


#Features

Random Maze Generation: Generates a new maze layout using a depth-first search algorithm.

Maze Solver: Solves the maze from the starting point to the exit, visualized in yellow.

Interactive Gameplay: Players can navigate the maze using arrow keys to reach the exit.

Scoring System: Tracks and displays the score based on the number of moves made.

Game Over Screen: Displays a game over message when the player reaches the exit.

#Instructions

#Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Install Pygame library using pip install pygame.

#How to Play:

Start the game by pressing any key.

Navigate the player character (blue square) through the maze using arrow keys.

Reach the yellow cell to win the game.

Press ESC to quit the game at any time.

#Objective:

The goal is to navigate the maze from the starting point (green) to the exit (yellow).

The maze is randomly generated each time, providing a new challenge with each play.

#Customization:

Modify the game settings such as maze size and difficulty by adjusting constants in the code (e.g., WIDTH, HEIGHT, FPS).

#Game Over:

Once the player reaches the exit, a game over screen appears.

Press any key to restart the game and try to achieve a better score.
